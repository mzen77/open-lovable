# ðŸš€ Manual Deployment Instructions

Since the automatic deployment didn't start, here's how to manually deploy:

## Option 1: Vercel Web Interface (Easiest)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel
- Open: https://vercel.com/new
- Make sure you're logged in with GitHub

### Step 2: Import Repository
1. Click "Import Git Repository"
2. If you see "Configure GitHub App" - click it
3. Grant access to your `open-lovable` repository
4. Go back to Vercel import page

### Step 3: Select Your Repository
- You should now see `mzen77/open-lovable`
- Click "Import"

### Step 4: Configure Project Settings
Leave these as default:
- **Project Name**: open-lovable
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Root Directory**: ./
- **Build Settings**: (keep defaults)

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables
Click "Environment Variables" and add each one:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| E2B_API_KEY | your_e2b_key_here |
| FIRECRAWL_API_KEY | your_firecrawl_key_here |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | your_anthropic_key_here |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | your_openai_key_here |
| GEMINI_API_KEY | your_gemini_key_here |
| GROQ_API_KEY | your_groq_key_here |

### Step 6: Deploy
- Click "Deploy"
- You'll see the build logs immediately
- Wait 3-5 minutes for completion

## Option 2: Command Line Deployment

If you have Node.js on your computer:

### 1. Clone Repository Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzen77/open-lovable.git
cd open-lovable
```

### 2. Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 3. Deploy
```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- Set up and deploy: Yes
- Which scope: Your account
- Link to existing project: No
- Project name: open-lovable
- Directory: ./
- Override settings: No

### 4. Add Environment Variables
```bash
vercel env add E2B_API_KEY
vercel env add FIRECRAWL_API_KEY
vercel env add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Add others as needed
```

### 5. Deploy to Production
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Option 3: Try Netlify Instead

If Vercel isn't working:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose GitHub â†’ Select `open-lovable`
5. Deploy settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
6. Click "Deploy site"

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found"
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/installations
- Find Vercel
- Click "Configure"
- Add repository access for `open-lovable`

### "Build failed"
- Make sure all required API keys are added
- Check that keys don't have spaces
- Try deploying without all keys first (just ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

### "Nothing happens after clicking deploy"
- Check if pop-up blocker is blocking Vercel
- Try a different browser
- Clear cookies for vercel.com

## Verification

After deployment starts, you should see:
1. Build logs streaming in real-time
2. Steps like "Installing dependencies", "Building", etc.
3. A URL like: `https://open-lovable-xxx.vercel.app`

## Still Not Working?

Try this direct link with your repo pre-filled:
